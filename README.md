# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

I would like to the get more practice with forms, and in this case i would've liked to add a form that allows people to apply for a position at the coffeeshop.
I also would like to learn how to make a form that shows a catalog of books that users can scroll and click through that also allows these users to rent them. I think this would be helpful because not only could it improve this webpage but i could take those skills with me elsewhere and to my future projects to continue building and learning.
